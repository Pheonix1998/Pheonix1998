### 📌 Why This Project?

This project simulates how a digital music company would build a reliable reporting system from raw transactional data.

Instead of just creating charts, the focus was on:
- Making revenue numbers accurate  
- Building a clean reporting table  
- Extracting insights that support real business decisions  

---

### 🎯 Business Problem

The data was stored across 11 related tables (customers, invoices, tracks, artists, genres, playlists, etc.).

The main challenges were:

- Revenue was getting duplicated due to incorrect joins  
- Date formats were inconsistent  
- Some customer data had corrupted characters  
- Price columns were not properly formatted  

Because of this, revenue reports were unreliable and could not be trusted for decision-making.

The business needed:
- A single accurate revenue source  
- Clear visibility into top customers and products  
- Reliable monthly and yearly trends  
- Insights into what products are often bought together  

---

### 🛠 My Approach

#### 1️⃣ Cleaned and Validated the Data
- Fixed corrupted characters  
- Standardized date formats  
- Converted price columns safely to numeric values  
- Handled missing values properly  

This ensured the data was ready for accurate analysis.

---

#### 2️⃣ Built a Reliable Reporting Table

Created a new table (`MUSIC_FACT`) with:
- One row per invoice line  
- No duplicate revenue  
- Proper date and numeric formats  

Revenue validation check used:

`Invoice Total = Unit Price × Quantity`

This step ensured financial accuracy before performing any analysis.
