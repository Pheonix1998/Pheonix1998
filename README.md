### 1.  🎵 Music Sales Analysis – Revenue & Customer Insights

**Tools Used:** SQL (SQL Server) | Python | Streamlit Dshboard

---

### 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a digital music store dataset to understand revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
The goal was to clean raw sales data, build a reliable reporting table, and create dashboards that help business teams make better decisions.

---

### 🎯 Business Problem

The original data was spread across 11 multiple related tables (customers, invoices, tracks, artists, genres, playlists, etc.).

There were several issues:
- Revenue was getting counted multiple times due to incorrect joins  
- Date formats were inconsistent  
- Some customer data had corrupted characters  
- Price columns were not properly formatted  

Because of this, reports were unreliable.

The business needed:
- A single accurate source for revenue reporting  
- Clear visibility into top customers and top products  
- Monthly and yearly revenue trends  
- Insights into what products are often bought together  

---

### 🧠 What I Did ?

#### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Fixed corrupted characters in customer fields  
- Standardized date formats  
- Safely converted price columns to numeric values  
- Replaced incorrect or missing values  

#### 2️⃣ Built a Clean Reporting Table
- Created a new table (`MUSIC_FACT`) with one row per invoice line  
- Removed duplicate revenue caused by many-to-many joins  
- Verified revenue accuracy using:

  `Invoice Total = Unit Price × Quantity`

This ensured that all revenue calculations were correct.

#### 3️⃣ Performed Business Analysis

**Customer Analysis**
- Top 10 customers by spending  
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)  
- Repeat vs one-time buyers  
- Average time between purchases  

**Sales & Revenue Analysis**
- Monthly and yearly revenue trends  
- Peak sales periods  
- Average invoice value  
- Revenue by country and city  

**Product Analysis**
- Top tracks and artists by revenue  
- Revenue by genre  
- Media format performance  
- Tracks that were never purchased  

**Basket Analysis**
- Tracks frequently purchased together  
- Cross-selling opportunities

### 📊 Streamlit Dashboard

I built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to present the insights in a simple and visual way.

**Dashboard Features:**
- Total Revenue  
- Total Invoices  
- Average Invoice Value  
- Total Customers  
- Revenue trends over time  
- Top artists, genres, and tracks  
- Customer segmentation

This allows users to filter by year, country, and genre to explore the data.

- Identified top revenue-generating artists and genres  
- Found peak sales months
